# Google-Homepage-Clone

This project was to clone the Google homepage. I created this website by utilizing flexbox and ul elements. Some of the features include a box-shadow 
appearing 0.3 seconds after hovering over the search bar and buttons, and underlining links when hovered just like the Google homepage. I tried to 
get a font as close as possible to Product Sans (Google's font) because Google has full rights to that font. I ended up utilizing Montserrat as it
closesly resembles Product Sans. This was a great project/excersize and replicating Google's homepage was enjoyable.

Thank you for checking it out!
